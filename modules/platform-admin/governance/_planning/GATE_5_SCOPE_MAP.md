## 1) Purpose

This document maps the scope of each gate in the Gate 5.x series, defining:

- What each gate is responsible for
- What is explicitly out of scope for each gate
- Dependencies between gates
- Verification requirements

---

## 2) Gate 5.1 — Organization Management

### 2.1 Scope

**Responsibility**: Organization operations (create, list, get, suspend, unsuspend)

**Note**: Gate 5.1 was executed as "DB integration skeleton" (Prisma DI + organization repository + wiring test). Controllers, services, DTOs, and full integration tests were deferred to future gates to maintain incremental delivery and fail-closed enforcement.

**Allowed**:

- Organization controller + routes (GET, POST, PATCH)
- Organization service + business logic
- Organization repository + database access
- Prisma schema for `Organization` model
- Database migrations for organization table
- DTO for organization create/update/response
- Unit tests for service + repository
- Integration tests for controller
- Fail-closed invariants tests (no RBAC/auth yet)

**Deliverables**:

- `OrganizationController` with routes:
  - `POST /platform-admin/organizations` (create)
  - `GET /platform-admin/organizations` (list)
  - `GET /platform-admin/organizations/:id` (get one)
  - `PATCH /platform-admin/organizations/:id/suspend` (suspend)
  - `PATCH /platform-admin/organizations/:id/unsuspend` (unsuspend)
- `OrganizationService` with business logic
- `OrganizationRepository` with database access
- Prisma schema + migrations
- Tests (unit + integration + security)

### 2.2 Out of Scope

❌ **Core Integration**: No Core API calls (deferred to Gate 5.2)
❌ **Org Mapping**: No Suite ↔ Core mapping (deferred to Gate 5.2)
❌ **Template Publishing**: No template operations (deferred to Gate 5.3)
❌ **RBAC**: No role-based access control (deferred to Gate 5.6)
❌ **Authorization Logic**: No auth implementation (future gate)
❌ **Audit Logging**: No audit trail (deferred to Gate 5.5)

### 2.3 Verification

- TypeScript compilation passes
- All tests pass (unit + integration + security)
- No Core API calls made
- No org mapping logic present
- Fail-closed enforcement preserved

## 9) Signature

**Status**: TEMPORARY — PLAN ONLY
**Approval**: Pending governance review
**Next Step**: Await explicit approval before Gate 5.1 execution
